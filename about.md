Howdy, my name is Luke Terry and I'm a software engineer and technologist based in London.

I have been in industry since 2010 and currently work as a Director (read: team lead) at a great company called [MindLink] using the latest in web technologies and C#.

My main focus is in web and on-premise application development, but I enjoy dabbling in other languages and cloud-based services.
Here's some highlights of what I'm currently working with:

* [Typescript]
* [React]
* [SASS]
* [Webpack]
* [Jasmine]
* [Karma]
* C#
* Windows Communication Foundation
* [OWIN] and ASP.net
